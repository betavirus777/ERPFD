# UI Implementation Plan

## ✅ Header - DONE
- Improved styling
- Logo added
- Better user menu

## 🚧 Building Now - Projects UI

### Pages to Create:
1. `/projects` - Project list
2. `/projects/[id]/tasks` - Kanban board  
3. `/timesheets` - Weekly timesheet

### Components to Build:
Due to complexity, implementing SIMPLIFIED versions that work:

1. **ProjectList** - Table of projects
2. **TaskBoard** - Simple column-based task view
3. **TimesheetWeek** - Basic weekly grid

This is a LARGE UI build - focusing on functional first, then polish.
